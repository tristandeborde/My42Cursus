# LEM_IN

**Learning goals :** ECS game architecture, dynamic libraries, name-mangling & "extern" keyword.

## Intro

The goal of the project is to code a working copy of the Snake video game. There's a twist: the user must be able to change the graphics library at runtime, by pressing a keyboard key.

## Usage

First, you have to  `make -j`; a game window will pop-up.
- You can change the library by pressing one of the `123` keys.
- You can move the snake around with the arrow keys.

## Contributors
This was a group project; contributors can be found here: github.com/{fauconfan,blefeuvr,talasta,julienhache}

### Bonus
The project is called Bombler because we are working on developing a Bomberman emulator on the same engine. This part is still a work in progress.
