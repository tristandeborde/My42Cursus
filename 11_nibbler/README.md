# LEM_IN

**Learning goals :** ECS game architecture, dynamic libraries, name-mangling & "extern" keyword.

## Intro

The goal of the project is to code a working copy of the Snake video game. There's a twist: the user must be able to change the graphics library at runtime, by pressing a keyboard key.

## Usage

First, you have to  `make -j`. Once compiled, run `./bombler` to launch the game.
- You can change the library by pressing one of the `123` keys.
- You can move the snake around with the arrow keys.

### Bonus
We are also working on completing another 42 school project, whose goal is to create a Bomberman emulator called "Bombler". This part is still a work in progress, for which we plan to use the same game engine as a bonus.
