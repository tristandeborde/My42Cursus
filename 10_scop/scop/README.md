# SCOP

**Learning goals:** OpenGL, GLSL, 3D Math.

The goal of the project is to code a 3D renderer able to parse .obj files, apply textures to objects, then display and rotate them.

## Usage

Run `make -j` to build the executable file. Once compiled, run `./scop resources/teapot.obj` to launch the renderer on the teapot file.
Runtime texture application is a WIP. FPS Camera mode is enabled by default.
