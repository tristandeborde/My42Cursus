# LEM_IN

**Project Objectives :** Graph algorithms, Stack concept

## Intro

This project introduces you to graphing algorithms: the program will have to intelligently select the precise paths and movements that the ants must take.

## Usage

First, you have to  `make` and then output data to the executable **`lem-in`** to get the instructions.

```
>> cat [map_path] | ./lem-in
10
... # map info
6-5

L1-3
... # instructions
L10-0
```

### Bonus
All graphical projects are done with the minimalist **Mini-LibX**.
1.	Graphical map builder : **`dark-mole`**

2. Graphical instruction checker : `**esc-caper**`

You can use the 3 programs together this way : **`./dark-mole | ./lem-in | ./esc-caper`**
